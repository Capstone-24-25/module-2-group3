### HTML scraping

Does including header content improve predictions? Answer the question and provide quantitative evidence supporting your answer.

**Answer**: Including the header content did not significantly improve predictions. We parsed through the paragraphs and included header information as well as the paragraph content. Then we tokenized the data and fit a logistical principal component regression model to it. After further analysis, we got an accuracy of 0.511. This suggests that augmenting the header content did not improve predictions significantly as by random chance, it would have been 0.5.

### Bigrams

Do bigrams capture additional information relevant to the classification of interest? Answer the question, **briefly** describe what analysis you conducted to arrive at your answer, and provide quantitative evidence supporting your answer.

**Answer**: For this part, we performed another tokenization. This time, we set n=2 to get bigrams. We then turned it into a document matrix in order to fit it through logistic principal regression. Then we used the log-odds-ratio and the principal components to fit it through another logistic regression model. After analysis, we got that the accuracy was 0.519. This means that bigrams do not seem to significantly capture additional information about the claims status of a page.
